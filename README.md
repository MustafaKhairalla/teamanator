<hr>

<p>Welcome to Teamanator! We are committed to providing managers with a no-cost and simple web app to manage their teams or groups.</p>

<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>As a User,

I want to be able to manage a group of people, all in one convenient location.

I want to be able to view different memebers of my team, add members, and delete them if needed.

I also would like to be able to view a To-Do list, upcoming events, and a calendar, all in one place.
</p>

<h2>Navigating the App is Simple to Use:</h2>

<p>On the homepage, log in to your account, or create a new one.</p>

<p>If it's the user's first visit, they'll be prompted to select a type of team and add team members. After this is complete, the user will
be directed to the dashboard.</p>

<p>If the user already has an account with us, they'll be directed to their personalized dashboard.</p>

<p>From the dashboard, the user can manage their own team with many tools.</p>

<p>It's just that simple!</p>
